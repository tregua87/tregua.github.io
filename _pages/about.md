Hi folks!  
I am a geeky guy who likes cybersecurity. I mainly deal with trusted computing. In particular, I play with SGX and TrustZone, but not only.

I earned my Master Degree in Verona (Italy) under the supervision of assistant professor [Damiano Carra](http://profs.sci.univr.it/~carra/).

At the moment I am a Ph.D. Student at [Singapore University of Technology and Design](http://www.sutd.edu.sg/) under the supervision of professor [Jianying Zhou](http://jianying.space/).

If you are interested in my works, let's browse the nav bar above.  
Enjoy.
