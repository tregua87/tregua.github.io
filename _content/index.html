<b>LOOKING FOR A BACHELOR'S OR A MASTER'S THESIS PROJECT?</b><br>
My research interests stretch beyond automated testing and reach other system
security areas. Explore potential <a href="projects.html">topics</a>. If you
already have an idea, feel free to reach out! I am happy to listen to personal
proposals.

</p>

<p>Dr. Toffalini earned his Ph.D. from the Singapore University of Technology
and Design (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.sutd.edu.sg">SUTD</a>) under the
supervision of Professor <a target="_blank"
href="http://jianying.space/">Jianying Zhou</a>. His doctoral thesis explored
the intersection of trusted execution environmentsâ€”particularly SGX and
TrustZoneâ€”and software engineering, identifying new attack surfaces and
proposing innovative defense mechanisms.</p>

<p>Following his Ph.D., Dr. Toffalini joined the <a target="_blank"
href="https://hexhive.epfl.ch/">HexHive</a> group as a Postdoctoral Researcher
under the guidance of Professor <a target="_blank"
href="https://nebelwelt.net/">Mathias Payer</a>. During his stay at EPFL, he
expanded his expertise in automatic software testing and threat mitigation.</p>

<p>At RUB, Dr. Toffalini continues his pioneering research in system security.
He is actively recruiting Ph.D. students to join his team and contribute to
cutting-edge projects in automatic software testing, threat mitigation, and
trusted computing. Current opportunities include research on browser and
interpreter testing. </p>
