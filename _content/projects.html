<h1>Projects</h1>

<p>
This is a list of possible available topis suitable for MSc, BSc, or simple
semester projects.</br>

Each project is adjustable according to the student skills. However, to ensure a
fruitful interaction, and make your project really worthy, I <b>strongly</b>
recommend you read the <b>general prerequisite</b> here below, and then the
topic description. If any of the following idea attracts you, or something is
unclear, do not hesitate to contact me at <a
href="mailto:flavio.toffalini@rub.de">flavio.toffalini@rub.de</a>. I am also
open to projects spontaneously proposed by student as long as they adhere to my
research area: software analysis, vulnerability analysis, mitigation, system
security. 
</p>

<h5>General Prerequisite</h5>
<p>
Every topic requires specific skills. However, for smooth collaboration,
students must have a basic understanding of Linux OS, Git, and bash programming.
I assume you have a good knowledge of Python, which is a fundamental Swiss Army
knife for many tasks. Depending on the project, you may also be required to
learn specific tools, skills, or technologies, such as C/C++, LLVM, reverse
engineering, or fuzzing.
</p>

<h5>List of Topics</h5>

<p>
The following topics serve as an indication of my areas of interest. Many of
them can be combined if we identify a feasible project. Think of this list as a
menu; if you find something you're already familiar with, feel free to email me,
and we can discuss it. As a rule of thumb, combining topics generally increases
project difficulty.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Generic Fuzzzing</b>, playing with <a
    href="https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus" target="_blank">AFL++</a>
    and <a href="https://github.com/AFLplusplus/LibAFL"
    target="_blank">libAFL</a>. If you're eager to find bugs in a specific
    target, we can discuss it!</li>
    <li><b>Interpreted Fuzzing</b>, with a focus on <a
    href="https://github.com/googleprojectzero/fuzzilli/"
    target="_blank">Fuzzilli</a>. We may extend Fuzzilli to new programming
    languages (e.g., Python).</li>
    <li><b>Reverse Engineering</b>. How hard would it be to translate assembly code to
    C++? ;)</li>
    <li><b>Software Analysis</b>, you will explore various static analysis
    techniques, possibly working on and extending <a
    href="https://github.com/SVF-tools/SVF" target="_blank">SVF</a>. This topic
    may evolve into a compiler pass to implement mitigation strategies. A strong
    background in <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project" target="_blank"
    >LLVM</a> is preferred.
    </li>
    <li>Many minor and major projects on <b>Trusted Execution Environment
    (TEE)</b> involving 
        <a href="https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx" target="_blank">SGX</a> or
        <a href="https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware"
        target="_blank">TrustZone</a>, but also spanning to <a
        href="https://github.com/canonical/tdx" target="_blank">Intel TDX</a> or
        <a
        href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/Stack-instrumentation-with-ARM-Memory-Tagging-Extension-(MTE)/5dc1d66c34d5fbf50daf3e27de590e1a62e85e56"
        target="_blank">ARM MTE</a> . This topic is very flexible and can be
        stretched to remote attestation or embedded security.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Microarchitectural</b> issues are more of a hobby area in my
        research; feel free to approach me, and we can explore possible ideas
        together.
    </li>
