<h1>Projects</h1>

This is a list of possible available topis that can become for MSc, BSc, or
simple semester projects.</br>

Each project is adjustable according to the student skills. However, to ensure a
fruitful interaction, and make your project really worthy, I <b>strongly</b>
recommend you read the <b>general prerequisite</b> here below, and the specific
project description. If any of the following idea attracts you, or something is
unclear, do not hesitate to contact me at <a
href="mailto:flavio.toffalini@rub.de">flavio.toffalini@rub.de</a>. I am also
open to projects spontaneously proposed by student as long as they adhere to my
research area: software analysis, vulnerability analysis, mitigation, system
security. 
</br>

<p>
<h5>General Prerequisite</h5>
Every project requires specific skills. However, for smooth collaboration,
students must have a basic understanding of Linux OS, git, and bash programming.
I assume you have a good knowledge of Python, which is a fundamental Swiss Army
knife for many tasks. Depending on the project, you may also be required to
learn specific tools, skills, or technologies, such as C/C++, LLVM, reverse
engineering, or fuzzing.

<p>
    <h5>JavaScript Fuzzing</h5>
    In this project, we will 
</p>

<p>
    <h5>Reverse Engineering</h5>
    C/C++ reverse things
</p>

<p>
    <h5> Microarchitectural attacks</h5>
    If you wanna smash AWS, here is your place!
</p>

<p>
    <h5>Software Analysis</h5>
    Study SVF and compare it with LLVM before and after.
