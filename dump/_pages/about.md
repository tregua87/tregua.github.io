Hi folks!  
I am a geeky guy who likes cybersecurity.  I mainly deal with trusted computing. In particular, I play with SGX and TrustZone, but not only.
Currently, I am moving to fuzzing and software analysis.

I defenced my Ph.D. at [Singapore University of Technology and Design](http://www.sutd.edu.sg/) in September 2021.
Currently, I am working as PostDoc with [Mathias Payer](https://nebelwelt.net/) in the [HexHive](https://hexhive.epfl.ch/).

If you are interested in my works, let's browse the nav bar above.  
Enjoy.
